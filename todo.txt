// todo:
- BUG: the connection between a biquadfilter and a gain node doesn't seem to get reflected in the exported json. i.e. for the 
biquadfilter you get an empty "feedsInto" list when it should have the gain node. try osc -> biquad -> gain.

- make the audio buffer node actually useful? more customizable (i.e. samples)
- show the ADSR curve
- color-coding for ADSR envelopes depending on target property (i.e. if targeting gain, the connector could be blue. if targeting
  frequency, the connector could be green?)

// other random notes:
ADSREnvelope {attack: 0.54, sustain: 0, decay: 0.53, release: 0, sustainLevel: 0, …

- when refactoring, keep these things in mind?:
     the UI modification code (i.e. drawing the svg lines, node elements) maybe could be its own class? something like UIModifier or UIEditor.
	
- there should be a distinction between connecting nodes and connecting to audio params. use a dotted line for params? also,
  arrows for the lines would be helpful.

- release with ADSR can act kinda funny - after the release timespan sometimes the note would pick up again and blip a couple times.
